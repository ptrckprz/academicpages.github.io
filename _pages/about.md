[//]: # (* Valeo.ai will be at Valeo booth at CVPR, Salt Lake City, 19-21 June 2018, come and visit us.)

* [Valeo.ai](https://ptrckprz.github.io/valeoai/) started in March 2018 in the center of Paris. We are hiring highly motivated researchers, postdocs and PhD students to embark on this exciting adventure.  We are hiring Research Scientists in Prague as well.

* The workshop "[Deep learning: From theory to applications](https://www.lebesgue.fr/content/sem2018-deeplearning)" was held at Technicolor in Rennes, France, 4-6 September 2018. We had a variety of great talks, including six keynotes by **Matthieu Cord** (UPMC/Valeo.ai), **Stéphane Mallat** (ENS Paris/Collège de France), **François Pachet** (Spotify), **Olivier Pietquin** (Google Brain), **Cordelia Schmid** (Inria/Google) and **Pierre Vandergheynst** (EPFL).  

* The "[Summer School on Signal and Image Processing](http://www.gretsi.fr/peyresq18/cours.php)" was held in Peyresq (lovely village in the French Alps), 1-7 July 2018. I joined  **Pierre Vandergheynst** (EPFL), **Monika Dorfler** (U. Vienna), **Jean-François Cardoso** (Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris), **Camille Couprie** (FAIR) and **Manuel Moussallam** (Deezer) in delivering the courses.
