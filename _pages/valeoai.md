## Some projects

**Multi-sensor perception**: Automated driving relies first on a diverse range of sensors, like Valeo's cameras, LiDARs, radars and ultrasonics. Exploiting at best the outputs of each of these sensors at any instant is fundamental to understand the complex environment of the vehicle. To this end, we explore various deep learning approaches where sensors are considered both in isolation and collectively.

**Domain adaptation**: Deep learning and reinforcement learning are key technologies for autonomous driving. One of the challenges they face is to adapt to conditions which differ from those met during training. To improve systems' performance in such situations, we explore so-called "domain adaption" techniques, as in [AdvEnt](https://github.com/valeoai/ADVENT), our project presented at CVPR 2019.  

**Uncertainty estimation and performance prediction**: When the unexpected happens, when the weather badly degrades, when a sensor gets blocked, the embarked perception system should diagnose the situation and react accordingly, e..g, by calling an alternative system or the human driver. With this in mind, we investigate automatic ways to assess the uncertainty of a system and to predict its performance.
